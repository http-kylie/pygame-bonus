# Setting up the environment with Pygame
Goal: Import library and initialise Pygame

What you'll learn:
1. import pygame: We need to import Pygame because it brings all the tools and functions we need to create our game. Without importing Pygame, your programme won't have access too the things that make games work!
2. pygame.init(): Initialises all the Pygame modules. Think of it like flipping a switch to turn on all the different parts of the game. This function turns on all the parts of Pygame so you can start creating your game. 

```python
import pygame

pygame.init()
```
# Creating the display window
